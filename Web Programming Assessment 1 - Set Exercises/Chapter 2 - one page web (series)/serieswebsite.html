                <h4>Lives up to all the hype</h4>
                <h5>By: Supermanfan-13</h5>
                <p>Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 is going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Absolutely Love This Show</h4>
                <h5>By: caleb_mcd</h5>
                <p>One of the best shows around. Awesome, creative story telling. Great rounded characters played by wonderful cast. Top notch GCI and effects. Perfect show that can be watched over and over.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What A Watch Must See!</h4>
                <h5>By: BrnzReviews</h5>
                <p>Stranger Things was an amazing surprise upon watching it I had no idea what kind of adventure was ahead of me. The best way to put this show is a love letter to the '80s classics that captivated a generation. 'Stranger Things' is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl. I loved everything about this show, the cast were absolutely breathtaking, If I started to note on each one I liked we'd be here all day but some really did stand out to me like Joe Kreery as Steve Harrington, by far my favourite from start to nearly finish as we have one more round to go. I highly recommend watching this, I absolutely loved it! Bring on season to 5!</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Definitely a favorite.</h4>
                <h5>By: bmasdhs</h5>
                <p>The monsters. The 80s nostalgia. The pacing. This show is so well done. It keeps a solid pace and it makes sure to keep everything correct to the time, even the food packages. Definitely recommend watching.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Never fails to satisfy</h4>
                <h5>By: magnoliacream</h5>
                <p>Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied. There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical. 
                It's definitely one of the best series on Netflix.</p>
